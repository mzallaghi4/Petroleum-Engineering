# Reactive Transport Modeling and Geochemical Modeling

This repository contains code, data, and examples related to reactive transport modeling and geochemical modeling.

## About 

Reactive transport modeling is a technique used to simulate the solute and transport of chemical species in porous media. 
It involves solving a set of coupled partial differential equations that describe the transport of solutes, the reactions between them, and changes in porosity and permeability due to mineral dissolution and precipitation. Geochemical modeling, on the other hand, is the study of the chemical composition and processes that take place in Earth's crust, including the formation and transformation of minerals and rocks.

This repository provides resources for reactive transport modeling, including:

- Code for numerical simulations using popular software packages such as PHREEQC and OpenFOAM
- Example datasets and scripts for running simulations and analyzing results.
- Tutorials and documentation for getting started with reactive transport modeling
-

## Contents
