# Reservoir Simulation

This repository contains code and data related to reservoir simulation. The goal of this project is to model the behavior of fluid flow in subsurface reservoirs.

Content:
 - Single flow simulation
 - Two Phase flow simulation

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You also need to install a few Python packages:

```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

The main file in this repository is `reservoir_simulation.py`. This file contains functions that implement various reservoir simulation algorithms. To run this file, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the file is located. Then type:

```
python reservoir_simulation.py
```

This will run the simulation and generate a plot showing the pressure distribution in the reservoir over time.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in the `data` directory. This directory contains several text files with information about the reservoir properties, such as permeability and porosity.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find a bug or want to suggest an improvement, please create a new issue on the Github repository page. If you want to contribute code, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
