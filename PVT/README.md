# PVT and Fluid Phase Behavior

This repository contains examples and tools related to the study of pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) behavior and fluid phase behavior.

## Contents

The following sections describe the contents of this repository:


### Examples

The `examples` directory contains scripts and notebooks that demonstrate how to use various equations of state and other methods to calculate PVT and fluid phase behavior properties. 
Currently, the following examples are available:

- Peng-Robinson Equation of State
- Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equation of State
- Twu Coon Parameterization
- Wax Precipitation Calculations
- Asphaltene Precipitation Calculations
- Differential Liberation Analysis

### Tools

The `tools` directory contains Python modules and scripts that can be used to perform various calculations related to PVT and fluid phase behavior. Currently, the following tools are available:

- EOS: A module that provides several equations of state for calculating thermodynamic properties of fluids.
- VLE: A module that provides functions for calculating vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) properties using equations of state.
- Wax: A module that provides functions for calculating wax precipitation using empirical correlations.
- Asphaltene: A module that provides functions for calculating asphaltene precipitation using empirical correlations.
- DLA: A module that provides functions for performing differential liberation analysis.
