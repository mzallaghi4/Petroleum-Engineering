# Wellbore Flow Modeling

This repository contains code and documentation related to wellbore flow modeling. 
The aim of this project is to provide tools for simulating fluid flow in oil and gas wells, with a focus on predicting production rates, pressure drops, and other important parameters.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src`: Source code for the wellbore flow simulator
- `docs`: Documentation for the wellbore flow simulator
- `examples`: Example input files and scripts for running the wellbore flow simulator
- `tests`: Automated tests for the wellbore flow simulator

## Getting started

To get started with using the wellbore flow simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies (see below)
3. Run the example simulations in the `examples` directory
